        <h3>Setup</h3>

          <h6>Configure user information used across all local repositories</h6>  
          <ul>

            <li>git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]” 
              : set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history</li>
            <li>git config --global user.email “[valid-email]” 
              : set an email address that will be associated with each history marker</li>
            <li>git config --global color.ui auto
              : set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing</li>

          </ul>
        
          <h3>Setup and Init</h3>
          
        <h6>Configuring user information, initializing and cloning repositories</h6>
          <ul>
          <li>git init
            : initialize an existing directory as a Git repository</li>
          <li>git clone
            : retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL
          </li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Stage and Snapshot</h3>
        <h6>Working with snapshots and the git staging area</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>git status
            : show modified files in working directory, staged for the next commit.
          </li>
          <li>git add [file]
            : add a file as it looks now to the next commit.
          </li>
          <li>git reset
            : unstage a file while retaining the changes in the working directory.
          </li>
          <li>git diff
            : diff of what is changed but not staged.
          </li>
          <li>git diff --staged
            : diff of what is staged but not yet committed.
          </li>
          <li>git commit -m "desctriptive message about changes committed."
            : commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Branch and Merge</h3>
        <h6>Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>git branch
            : list your branches. A *  will appear next to the branch you are currently on.
          </li>
          <li>git branch [branch-name]
            : create a new branch at the current commit.
          </li>
          <li>git checkout
            : switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory.
          </li>
          <li>git merge
            : merge the specified branch's history into the current one.
          </li>
          <li>git log
            : show all commits in the current branch's history.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Inspect and Compare</h3>
        <h6>Examining logs, diffs, and object information</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>git log
            : show the commit history of the currently active branch.
          </li>
          <li>git log branchB.. branchA
            : show the commits on Branch A that are not on Branch B.
          </li>
          <li>git log --follow [file]
            : show the commits that changed file, even across renames.
          </li>
          <li>git diff branchB.. branchA
            : show the diff of what is BranchA that is not in branch B.
          </li>
          <li>git show [SHA]
            : show any object in Git in a human-readable format.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Tracking Path Changes</h3>
        <h6>Versioning file removes and path changes</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>git rm [file]
            : delete the file from the project and stage the removal for commit.
          </li>
          <li>git mv [existing-path] [new-path]
            : change an existing file path and stage the move.
          </li>
          <li>git log --stat -M
            : show all commit logs with indication of any paths that are moved
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ignoring Patterns</h3>
        <h6>Preventing unintentional staging or committing of files</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>git config --global core.excludesfile [file]
            : system wide ignore pattern for all local repositories.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Share and Update</h3>
        <h6>Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repos</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>git remote add [alias]  [url]
            : add a git  URL as an alias.
          </li>
          <li>git fetch [alias]
            : fetch down all the branches from that Git remote.
          </li>
          <li>git merge [alias]/[branch]
            : merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date
          </li>
          <li>git push [alias] [branch]
            : transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch.
          </li>
          <li>git pull
            : fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rewriting history</h3>
        <h6>Rewriting branches, updating commits and clearing history</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>git rebase [branch]
            : apply any commits of current branch ahead of specified one.
          </li>
          <li>git reset --hard [commit]
            : clear staging area, rewrite working tree from specified commit.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Temporary Commits</h3>
        <h6>Temporarily store modified, tracked files in order to change branches</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>git stash
            : save modified and staged changes.
          </li>
          <li>git stash list
            : list stack-order of stashed file changes
          </li>
          <li>git stash pop
            : write working from top of stash stack.
          </li>
          <li>git stash drop
            : discard the changes from top of stash stack.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Typical Workflow for branching and committing for PRs</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>git status to check branch and if there's uncommitted files</li>
          <li>git checkout -b [branch-name] to create a new branch</li>
          <li>git pull origin main to make sure you're editing on the most recent version of the files from the main branch.</li>
          <li>git add -A to add all files that were changed to be committed</li>
          <li>git commit -m "message about your updated code"</li>
          <li>git push origin [branch you've been editing on] to push the changes up to github on the branch.</li>
          <li>Go to github and create a PR</li>
          <li>Tag people you want to review the changes or merge it yourself if it's a solo project and you've verified everything works</li>
          <li>git checkout main to swap back to the main version of your newly updated code</li>
          <li>git pull origin main to pull the merged changes to main down from github.</li>
        </ol>
